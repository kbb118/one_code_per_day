// This file implements the C preprocessor.
//
// The preprocessor takes a list of tokens as an input and returns a
// new list of tokens as an output.
//
// The preprocessing language is designed in such a way that that's
// guaranteed to stop even if there is a recursive macro.
// Informally speaking, a macro is applied only once for each token.
// That is, if a macro token T appears in a result of direct or
// indirect macro expansion of T, T won't be expanded any further.
// For example, if T is defined as U, and U is defined as T, then
// token T is expanded to U and then to T and the macro expansion
// stops at that point.
//
// To achieve the above behavior, we attach for each token a set of
// macro names from which the token is expanded. The set is called
// "hideset". Hideset is initially empty, and every time we expand a
// macro, the macro name is added to the resulting tokens' hidesets.
//
// The above macro expansion algorithm is explainde in this document
// written by Dave Prossor, which is used as a basis for the
// standard's wording:
// https://github.com/rui314/chibicc/wiki/cpp.algo.pdf
