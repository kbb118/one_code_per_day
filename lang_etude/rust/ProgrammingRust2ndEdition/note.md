# Chapter 2. A Tour of Rust

## As a warm-up

We have a program that does a simple calculation on its command-line arguments, with unit tests.

./gcd


## Web server

We'll use a third-party libraly to handle the details of HTTP and introduce string handling, closures, and error handling.


## Plots a beautiful fractal

Our third program plots a beautiful fractal, distributing the computation across multiple threads for speed. This includes an example of a generic function, illustrates how to handle something like a buffer of pixels, and shows off Rust's suport for concurrency.


## Process file using regex

Finally, we show a robust command-line tool that processes files using regular expressions. This presents the Rust standard library's facilities for working with files, and the most commonly used third-party regular expression library.
